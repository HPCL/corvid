Corvid version history

Version 0.3 - March 12, 2020

Corvid is based on FluTE (https://github.com/dlchao/FluTE).

Several parameters were adjusted to adapt the FluTE flu transmission 
to Corvid coronavirus transmission, such as incubation period,
symptomatic fraction, and viral load trajectories.
The parallel computing version was removed, so populations of more than
10,000,000 will probably not run on a laptop.

Implemented a "work from home" policy.

Version 0.3 is the first version the outside world has seen.
