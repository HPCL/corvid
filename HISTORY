Corvid version history

Version 1.0 - March 5, 2020

Corvid is based on FluTE (https://github.com/dlchao/FluTE).

Used for early versions of Los Angeles County pandemic planning. 
School closure is permanent – schools don’t re-open after they are closed.

Several parameters were adjusted to adapt the FluTE flu transmission
to Corvid coronavirus transmission. Incubation period, symptomatic fraction, 
viral load trajectories.
The parallel computing version was removed, so populations of more than 10,000,000 will probably not run on a laptop.
